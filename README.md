# Kalman-Filter-on-Ball-Trajectory
Use a Kalman Filter to track the position of a ball in one dimension and Computer Vision to detect the ball

Use openCV to detect the ball and use its trajectory to calculate its trajectory.

Use the Kalman Filter equation to predict its position.

Report contains data results along with position vs time and variance graphs
